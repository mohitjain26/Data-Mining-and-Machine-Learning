# Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning Using R

During this project, our aim to improve our knowledge in the field of Machine Learning.
We had used three different types of dataset and run the comparative analysis during the execution, the datasets are- Airbnb, Online News Popularity and Bank Marketing.

1. Airbnb- The Berlin Airbnb data were used to run the machine learning model. In this we are going to create a price predictor model considering several factors like area, room type and others. During this implementation Multi Linear Regression and Random Forest Algorithm is used.

2. Bank Marketing- The data used is marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. Using this data we are going to create model in which decide whether the client has potential to subsrcibed for term deposit or not. During this implementation Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine Algorithm is used

3. Online News Popularity- This data is formed by the collection of various articles and the features defined of those article, also this dataset contain 61 attributes, which we are going to filter and then we will create a model which suggest the numbers of shares that the article might get. During this implementation Decision Tree and KNN Algorithm is used
